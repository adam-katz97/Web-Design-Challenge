    <h5>This purpose of this project is to examine if temperature increases the closer you get to the equator.
        To do this we pulled data from the OPENWEATHERMAP API to assemble a datasheet of over 500 cities. After assembling the datasheet, we used matplotlib
        to plot various aspects of the weather vs. latitude. Factors included temperature, cloudiness, windspeed and humidity. This site provides the source data and visualizations
        made as part of the analysis, as well as explanations and descriptions of the trends that were found.
