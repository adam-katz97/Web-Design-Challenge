    <h4>As you can see from this graph, humidity remains mostly consistent at every latitude. There are some
        small differences such as how low the humidity can be and that higher humidity's are slightly more 
        consistent in areas around the equator. We can then infer that latitude plays a small part in the humidity of
        a location.
