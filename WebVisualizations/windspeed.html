    <h4>As the graph shows, the wind speed is about the same no matter what latitude you are at. There is one
        trend that i noticed while looking at the chart. The higher the latitude is in the positive direction, the more
        concentrated the wind speeds become, as you can see by how there are so many dots bunched up between 3 and
        5 mph from latitude 20 to 70.
