# Web-Design-Challenge
There are seven html pages. The landing page contains a summary the data used to make the other pages as well as a sidebar of the four visualization pages that goes to each individual page when their respective picture is clicked. The four visualization pages have a brief summary of the data that was found when comparing latitude with some other type of data, like humidity or temperature. The data page contains all the data used to make the visualizations, made by converting a csv file to an html file. Finally the comparison page uses a bootstrap grid to display all four visuals with the layout changing depending on screen size. I had a little difficulty making it work but once i learned how to change the size of the images everything was fine.
